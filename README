PlayerTracker - Track movement of players
Version: v1.0

This plugin tracks the movement of players on your server chunk-wise.
Every time a player moves from one chunk to another is tracked in a textfile under plugins/PlayerTracker.
Each player has his own textfile. For example, player "kuckoobrain" has the file plugins/PlayerTracker/kuckoobrain.txt.
The structure of the textfile is as following:
date;time;environment;chunkx;chunkz

Features:
* Track chunk-wise movement of players to textfiles
* /chunk command to print the current chunk and environment

Changelog:
Version 1.0
* Releasing plugin
